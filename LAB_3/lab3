A1. Use librosa.effects.trim() to remove the silence parts of speech from beginning and end of your recorded signal. Listen to the new signal and perceptually compare the audio with original.
A2. Use librosa.effects.split() to split the recorded speech with detected silences. Play around with the top_db parameter and see the effects of split. Listen to the generated signals and observe the split quality.
A3. Use the IEEE paper reference available above for silence detection. Compare the results with the silence detection output from librosa package.
