A1. Use numpy.fft.fft() to transform the speech signal to its spectral domain. Please plot the amplitude part of the spectral components and observe it. Use numpy.fft.ifft() to inverse transform the frequency spectrum to time domain signal.
A2. Use a rectangular window to select the low frequency components from your spectrum. Inverse transform the filtered spectrum and listen to this sound. Repeat the same for band pass and high pass frequencies of spectrum.
A2. Repeat A2 with other filter types such as Cosine / Gausian filters.
